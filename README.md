# Butterfly Image Classification

This project involves developing a Butterfly Image Classification model using TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify different butterfly species based on their images.

## Overview

The Butterfly Image Classification model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify butterfly species. The model was trained on a diverse dataset, including images of various butterfly species, and was fine-tuned to improve its accuracy and performance.

## Features

- **TensorFlow**: The model is built using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning library.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilizes CNNs for image classification tasks, providing high accuracy in species identification.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes data augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness and generalization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oussamaF01/butterfly-classification.git
cd butterfly-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
